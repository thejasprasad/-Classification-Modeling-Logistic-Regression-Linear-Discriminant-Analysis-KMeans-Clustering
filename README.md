# Classification Modeling: Kobe Bryant’s Shot and Miss
This is a classification project using Kobe Bryant’s basketball stats data created over 20 years, models were created to predict whether or not he is expected to make shots given various conditions. With 20 years of basketball stats, Bryant has data on everything ranging from the location on the court that he took the shot to the average noise in the arena at the time of the game. The data was originally compiled with 5000 missing data points on whether or not Bryant made the shot. We used Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, KMeans Clustering algorithms to create the classification models. Among these Logistic Regression model performed the best. Python and SAS was used for the analysis.
